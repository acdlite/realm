# Realm

A total rip-off of the Elm architecture, in React.

Realm components are React components, so they are interoperable with non-Realm components. Use Realm for your entire app, or just in specific places.

### Why you should use this library

- You think Elm is awesome, but are stuck writing JavaScript for various practical reasons
- You like functional programming
- You like Redux

### Why you shouldn't use this library

- Because you should use Elm instead

Docs in progress. In the meantime, see this [test](https://github.com/acdlite/realm/blob/master/src/__tests__/realm-test.js) for an example.
